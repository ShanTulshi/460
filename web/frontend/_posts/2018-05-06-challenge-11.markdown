Good job... that's completely non-ironic and sincere :)

### Challenge 11

Let's try working with arrays. Declare an array of ints of length 10. Populate it with the numbers 1-10 in order and return the value at the 7th index.

## Hints
Look up the syntax for C arrays. Type and length are important and there are multiple ways to populate arrays.
