What's 17 squared? Seems irrelevent, no? Let's work on something more ... functional

### Challenge 17
Create a function mysteriousCalc which takes in the two int parameters low and high. Have it return (low+high) to the third power. Call this function using the int variables low1 and high1 and return the result.

## Hints
Function syntax can be quite simple. Remember that you need to specify return and parameter types.
