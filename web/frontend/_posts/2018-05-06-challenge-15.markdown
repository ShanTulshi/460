Fine... that was ... acceptable.

### Challenge 15

Your time with strings isn't over yet. Create two string variables fruit1 and fruit2 initialized with the names of your two most favorite fruits. Use `strncmp` to check if these strings are equal and return the result.

## Hints
`strncmp` takes in three paramters: the two strings and something very important. Try searching for this last parameter and understanding why it is necessary.
