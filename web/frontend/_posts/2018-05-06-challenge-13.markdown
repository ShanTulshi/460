Ooooo at lucky number 13. Or will it prove to be unlucky...

### Challenge 13

One dimensional arrays are so last challenge. Create another int array called rectangle of dimensions 5x4 and populate it with odd numbers. Assign 7 to the last index and return this index.

## Hints
Multidimensional aren't too different from one dimensional ones. This time you need to specify multiple sizes for each dimension.
