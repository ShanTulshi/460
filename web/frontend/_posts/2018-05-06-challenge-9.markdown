It seems you need to try something a bit harder.

### Challenge 9

Make a variable of type int named magic_num and initialize it with the value 777. Return this variable.

## Hints
An int in C is much like an int in many other languages. Make sure you have the correct syntax while decaling and initializing your variable. `;` is very important in C syntax.
