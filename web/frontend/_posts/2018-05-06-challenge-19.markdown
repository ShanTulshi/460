Well if you're not scared by pointers, we need to make things more complicated ...

### Challenge 19
What if we want to work with the value at the memory address that a pointer points to? This is called dereferencing the pointer. Dereference the pointer yashas_ptr and return the value.

## Hints
`*` <- this might be important once again. You can also look into `&` which you can use to get the memory address of a variable.
